# Goblin Mode - AR/VR Portfolio Project

## Overview
**Goblin Mode** is a 2D action-adventure game inspired by **Terraria**, **Stardew Valley**, and **Project Zomboid**. The player takes the role of a farmer/adventurer who manages a house, farms crops, and explores caves/dungeons to find gold, fight slimes and goblins, and unlock new areas. The game features farming, combat, and dungeon exploration mechanics to provide a balanced, immersive gameplay experience.

This project is part of my AR/VR portfolio and is currently in progress. The goal is to demonstrate my ability to create interactive, engaging 2D environments with smooth mechanics and polished user experiences.

## Progress So Far
At the end of the first two weeks, I have made significant progress on the following aspects of **Goblin Mode**:
- **Farming System**: Implemented crop planting, growth, and harvesting. The weather system is integrated, automatically watering crops when it rains.
- **Dungeon Exploration**: Players can enter and explore dynamically generated dungeons. The game handles transitions between the farm and dungeons seamlessly.
- **Combat System**: Added combat with enemies (slimes and goblins), including health tracking and simple AI for enemies.
- **Inventory Management**: Developed an inventory system where players can store and retrieve items from dungeons or the farm.
- **Saving System**: The game can save player progress, including inventory, dungeon exploration, and crop growth.
- **Basic UI**: Created a functional pause menu and basic player interface to track health, gold, and inventory items.

### Major Blockers
1. **Pathfinding and Enemy AI**: While simple enemy AI is functional, advanced behaviors such as avoiding obstacles and more complex enemy patterns are still in progress.
2. **Asset Integration**: Some of the custom assets Iâ€™m working with are large and can't be pushed to Github. This includes textures and licensed sounds.
3. **Optimization**: While the game runs smoothly, the dynamic tilemap generation in dungeons occasionally causes performance spikes, which I need to optimize.

### Milestones
- **Week 1-2**: Implement farming and dungeon exploration mechanics, basic combat system, and inventory management.
- **Week 3-4**: Polish combat, add more diverse enemies, and refine enemy AI and pathfinding. Continue optimizing dungeon generation.
- **Week 5-6**: Focus on balancing gameplay, adding more items, and finalizing the save/load system.

### To Do
- Improve enemy AI and add advanced behaviors.
- Further optimize the dungeon generation system.
- Integrate more in-game assets, such as new crops, weapons, and items.
- Complete polishing the user interface for a more seamless user experience.

## Assets
**Note**: Some large or licensed assets are not included in this repository due to file size limitations or licensing issues. You must have access to the following assets to fully utilize the project:
- Custom textures for enemies and dungeon environments.
- Licensed audio tracks and sound effects.

If you have these assets, place them in the following directories to ensure the game functions correctly:
- /assets/music
- /assets/UI
